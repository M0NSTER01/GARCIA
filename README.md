# Gracia: AI-Based Body Shape Detection Using Gemini

Gracia is a personal style recommendation website designed specifically for women. It utilizes AI-based body shape detection using the Gemini API to offer personalized advice on the best accessories and dresses to enhance your natural beauty.

## Features

- **Curated Recommendations:** Receive hand-picked suggestions for accessories and dresses that complement your unique figure.
- **Style Boost:** Enhance your look with tips and trends designed to boost your confidence and overall style.

## How It Works

2. **Receive Custom Recommendations:** Our system analyzes your data and curates a list of the best accessories and dresses.

## Demo

Experience Gracia in action by visiting our live demo at [Gracia Official](https://garciaofficial.netlify.app/).

> **Important Notice:**  
> The link above is an older version of the website that does not use any API. It is only a demo showcasing the website's interface and does not perform actual body shape detection. The output remains the same for every input.

> Since this project now uses the Gemini API for body shape detection, a free demo is no longer provided. To use this project, you must use your own Gemini API along with your own Supabase database.

## Gemini API & Supabase Integration

This project is now based on the Gemini API for body shape detection. To configure your API keys and database details, follow these instructions:

### Gemini API Configuration

1. Open the file: `src/services/geminiservices.ts`.
2. Locate line number 9 and update the API key:
   ```js
   const API_KEY = 'YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY'; // This key needs to be unrestricted in Google Cloud Console
   ```
   Replace 'YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY' with your actual Gemini API key.

### Supabase Configuration

**Client Setup:**

1. Open the file: `src/integration/client.ts`.
2. Update the configuration with your Supabase details:
   ```js
   const SUPABASE_URL = "YOUR_SUPABASE_URL";
   const SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY = "YOUR_SUPABSE_ANON_PUBLIC_KEY";
   ```

**Project ID Setup:**

1. Open the file: `/supabase/config.toml`.
2. Update the project ID:
   ```toml
   project_id = "YOUR_SUPABSE_PROJECTID"
   ```
   Replace with your actual Supabase project ID.

### Testing Your Integration

To test your API key and check which model your key supports, add `/TestGemini` to your URL.

This will redirect you to a page where you can:

- Test text generation for the specific model.
- Verify image identification capabilities.
